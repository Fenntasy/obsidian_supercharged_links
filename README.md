## Obsidian Internal Links supercharger

Internal links adds attributes to <a.internal-link> HTMLElements with the attributes and values of the target file's frontmatter.
Combined with css snippets, it allows a very flexible way to customize the links

It also adds context menu items to modifiy target note's frontmatter properties by right-clicking on the link

## Basic link styling

The plugin basically scans the target file of each internal link of the files that are currently opened in your workspace.

It gathers some specific front-matter properties and includes them in the html element of the link, with the value of the property contained in the target note's front matter section.

Complicated üò∞.... let's break it down step by step

### Front-matter

As a reminder, front-matter section is an optional section of your note written in Yaml. 
Here is the documentation about front-matter on Obsidian help website https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter

Let's say I have a note about Jim : Jim.md

```md
---
category: people
next-actions: [üë•, ‚òéÔ∏è, üçª, say hi]
age: 42
---

Jim is one of my colleagues

```

Let's say that I want to have a specific display of the internal-links linking to Jim's note to display a blue tag-like rounded rectangle <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/simple-styling.png" style="height:30px;vertical-align:bottom">  and display <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/simple-styling-hover.png" style="height:30px;vertical-align:bottom">  when hovering the link

### Settings

First you'll have to tell the plugin which front-matter kind of properties you want your internal-link to be supercharged with in the `Target Attributes for Styling` section of the plugin's settings

here are my settings

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/link-styling-settings.png" alt="drawing" style="width:400px;"/>

So in this case the plugin will only include `category`, `next-actions` and `tags` in the internal-links

### a.internal-links

When a file is opened or when one of the files of your vault has changed, the plugin is "supercharging" all internal-links with the front-matter properties set in the settings, if there are such properties in the file targeted by the link.

Let's say that I have a file daily.md like this:

Daily.md

```md
[[Jim]] will be organizing the weekly steering committee
```

Without the plugin activated, the html link element would normally look like this: 

```
<a data-href="Jim" href="Jim" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jim</a>
```

You wouldn't really know anything about Jim.md's specificity here and therefore wouldn't be able to customize it a lot.

That's where the plugin comes in: it will add two extra properties in the `<a>` element : `category` and `next-actions`. 
Since `tags` is not existing in Jim.md front-matter section, it won't be included.

**heads-up** the plugin is not adding directly `category` and `next-actions` property. Instead, it will prefix them with `data-link` in order not to potentially conflict with other attribute management ssystem made by other plugins or Obsidian itself.

So... with the plugin activated the `<a>`element will be supercharged like this: `<a data-href="Jim" href="Jim" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-link-category="people" data-link-next-actions="üë• ‚òéÔ∏è üçª say hi">Jim</a>`

As you can see, even if `tags` is included in settings as a property to track, since it's not included in Jim.md front-matter section, the property `data-link-tags` isn't included in the `<a>` element

### css

Now you can enjoy the flexibilty of css to customize your links by setting css properties in a snippet like `links.css`

exemple: 

to put a fancy üë§ emoji before the name of each link to a "category: people" note:
```css
a.internal-link[data-link-category$="People" i]::before{
    content: "üë§ "
}
```
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/link-styling-in-note.png" style="width:500px">

to highlight the link in a tag-like blue rounded rectangle when there is a property next-actions in the target file:

```css
a.internal-link[data-link-next-actions]{
    color: white;
    background-color: rgb(29, 29, 129);
    border-radius: 18px;
    padding: 5px 15px;
}
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links/master/images/link-styling-tag-in-note.png" style="width:500px">

to display the next actions contained in the next-actions property of the target file when hovering the link:

```css
a.internal-link[data-link-next-actions]:hover::after{
    content: " ‚ñ∫ "attr(data-link-next-actions)
}
```
